Corpus and code for argument mining in scientific abstracts in two scientific disciplines. Experiments with BERT-based models and domain adaptation from computational linguistics to biomedicine.

Code and data used in our paper:
Argumentation mining in scientific literature: From computational linguistics to biomedicine

In this work we propose to tackle the limitations posed by the lack of annotated data for argument mining in scientific texts by annotating argumentative units and relations in research abstracts in two scientific domains. We evaluate our annotations by computing inter-annotator agreements, which range from moderate to substantial according to the difficulty level of the tasks and domains. We use our newly annotated corpus to fine-tune BERT-based models for argument mining in single and multi-task settings, and we finally explore the adaptation of the models trained in one scientific discipline (computational linguistics) to predict the argumentative structure of abstracts in a different one (biomedicine).
